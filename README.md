## üß∞ Tools
+ [Mac Address Changer](#macchanger)
+ [Network Scanner](#network-scanner)
+ [Network Sniffer](#network-sniffer)
+ [Network Spoofer](#network-spoofer)

##  ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These tools are intended for educational purposes and ethical hacking practices only. Misusing these tools for malicious activities is strictly prohibited.

## üìü Mac Address Changer <a name = "macchanger"></a>
This script allows you to modify your device's Media Access Control (MAC) address. This can be useful for specific network security testing scenarios or bypassing basic MAC filtering mechanisms implemented by some networks. See [MAC Changer][1] for details.

## üîç Network Scanner <a name = "network-scanner"></a>
This script discovers active devices on a network. It typically uses ARP requests to identify devices and gather information like IP addresses and MAC addresses. See [Network Scanner][2] for details.

## üìÆ Network Sniffer <a name = "network-sniffer"></a>
This script eavesdrops on network traffic flowing across a network interface. It can be used to analyze communication protocols used by different devices, identify potential vulnerabilities in network communication, or troubleshoot network connectivity issues. This tool likely utilizes scapy library to capture and parse network packets into a human-readable format for further analysis. See [Network Sniffer][3] for details.

## üé≠ Network Spoofer <a name = "network-spoofer"></a>
This script can be used to manipulate network traffic by spoofing source or destination IP addresses. Network spoofing techniques can be used for malicious purposes, so it's crucial to employ this tool only in controlled environments and for educational purposes. This script likely leverages libraries like scapy to craft and inject spoofed packets that manipulate network communication. See [Network Spoofer][4] for details.
